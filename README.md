# Rancid Tomatillos

## Overview 

Inspired by the popular film rating sites, Rancid Tomatillos is a page where users can interact with a display of several movies and view specific information based on the movies chosen. 
A user can search movies by title, sort movies alphabetically, or see movies in order of their average rating.
